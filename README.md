<h1>My Game Library API</h1>

<h1>About</h1>

<p> This is the API for my Capstone Project at General Assembly. This API was built with Ruby on Rails using a one-to-many relationship.  I established relationships for users and games and required that there must be a new or existing user in order to use this application. After building out the API I created a heroku application to connect my Rails Server to the client.</p>
